# firebase_example

An example Firebase Flutter project.

## Setup

Create a symlink ```flutter``` to your flutter repo.

Create a symlink ```firebase``` to your firebase-dart repo.

```pub get```

```flutter start --debug``` (or ```--release```)

Until the ```flutter``` tool supports custom services, you'll need a
custom compiled Flutter engine with the Firebase Mojo service included.
Email jackson@google.com for instructions on how to do this.
